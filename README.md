[![OWASP](https://img.shields.io/badge/OWASP-darkblue?style=flat-square)](https://owasp.org/)

üìù **Description:** This project is a comprehensive vulnerability assessment conducted to identify security weaknesses in two critical systems: a Linux server and a Windows 11 machine. Using OpenVAS, the assessment uncovered one high-severity vulnerability, along with three medium and three low-severity findings. The most critical issue was an FTP vulnerability that allowed access using weak credentials, posing a risk of data breaches and compliance violations. To mitigate risks, immediate actions were recommended, such as enforcing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and replacing unsecured protocols (FTP/HTTP) with secure alternatives (SFTP/HTTPS). Long-term security improvements include regular vulnerability scans, firewall optimizations, and employee security awareness training. The recommendations align with NIST and MITRE cybersecurity frameworks to enhance system resilience and protect sensitive data.
